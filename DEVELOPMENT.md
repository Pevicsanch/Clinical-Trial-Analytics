# Development Notes

## AI-Assisted Workflow

This project was developed using Claude (via Cursor IDE) as a **review and refinement tool**.

### How AI assisted

The analysis, methods, and decisions are my own. AI helped improve and refine:

- **Code quality** — Refactoring, cleaner syntax, edge case handling
- **Writing clarity** — Notebook narratives and documentation
- **Visualizations** — Plot formatting, labels, readability  
- **SQL queries** — Structure and performance
- **Architecture** — Schema refinements, project organization
- **Consistency** — Naming conventions, style across files

### My contributions

- Research question formulation and scoping
- Statistical method selection (HHI, Kaplan-Meier, Cox PH, bootstrap CIs)
- Data quality assessment and limitation analysis
- Result interpretation and confidence judgments
- Core architectural choices (SQLite, ABT pattern, Docker setup)

### Example interactions

```
"Review this query for performance"
"Make this chart more readable"
"Is this interpretation statistically sound?"
"How can I structure this notebook more clearly?"
```

All code is fully understood and can be discussed in detail.
