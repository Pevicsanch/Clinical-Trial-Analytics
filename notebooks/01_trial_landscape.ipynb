    "**Research Activity:**\n",
    "- 10,000 clinical trials in dataset spanning 1990-2025\n",
    "- Peak activity in 2015-2020 period\n",
    "- Most trials are in Phase 2 (early efficacy testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Status Distribution:**\n",
    "- Majority of trials are completed (older trials)\n",
    "- Significant number still recruiting (recent trials)\n",
    "- High termination rate in early phases reflects inherent research risk\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therapeutic Focus:**\n",
    "- Cancer research is top priority (multiple cancer types in top 20)\n",
    "- Cardiovascular and metabolic diseases heavily studied\n",
    "- COVID-19 research emerged rapidly (58 trials despite recent appearance)\n",

    "### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Investment Concentration**: Research funding heavily concentrated in oncology and chronic diseases\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 Bottleneck**: Large number of Phase 2 trials suggests this is where most drugs are tested for efficacy\n",
    "3. **Completion Challenges**: Termination rates highlight difficulty of bringing drugs to market\n",
    "4. **Temporal Trends**: Steady growth in research activity over 30 years shows increasing clinical research capacity"
